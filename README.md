## Business Rules

- **Reservation Priority**: Reservations are handled on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can book a table for a specific date and time, subject to availability.
- **Queue System**: If no tables are available, users can join a waiting queue. The queue operates in order of arrival.
- **Notifications**: Users are notified (via the application interface) when their reservation is confirmed or when their turn in the queue arrives.
- **Reservation Limits**: Each user can hold only one active reservation at a time.
- **Cancellation**: Users can cancel reservations or leave the queue at any time.
- **Editing Reservations**: Existing reservations can be edited before the scheduled time, as long as there is availability.
- **No-show Policy**: If a user does not confirm or show up within a grace period, the reservation may be released to the next in the queue.

These rules ensure fair and efficient management of table reservations and the waiting queue in the OneCup cafeteria.
